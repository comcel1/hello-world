# hello-world
My name is Paul Nelson. I went to Belmont University as a commercial cellist, and I have been a professional musician for the last 20 years and am interested in developing some new skills. 
  One of my main clients is Brandon Michael Collins. Through him, I have worked with a plethora of artists.
